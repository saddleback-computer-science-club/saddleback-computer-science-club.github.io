## Info
The following pages have been created as resources to aid anyone who wishes to contribute to content to this website. I recommend going through these in the order that they appear, as some pages will build on those prior. If you have any further clarifying questions after reading these, or believe that some content on these pages is in need of correction, please contact me via Discord or email.

If you want to delve further into any of the concepts below, each page contains a curated list of resources that may provide further information. Most of these are not strictly necessary to read for understanding of how to contribute basic content, so view them at your discretion.
