Advent is code is a yearly event which has been running since 2015. It is structured like a traditional [advent calender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar), but instead of chocolates or sweets, users are presented with 25 coding problems on each day December 1st through 25th.

For more information on the event, please read its official [about page
](https://adventofcode.com/about). For the 2023 problems, see the [2023 calender page](https://adventofcode.com/about).

The problem set is extremely well written, with emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking. Minimal experience with programming is required. With a basic intro to programming course (i.e. CS1A), you should have all of the tools necessary to solve these problems including: variables, file input and output, loops, functions, and arrays. Each daily problem has a part one, and after solving that, a part two  building upon the former. 

Below are my solutions and explanations to each of the 25 problems for the 2023 event, or at least the ones I was able to solve and understand myself. However, I urge you to attempt to solve the problems yourself first.
