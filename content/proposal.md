To whom it may concern, everything following is my ideas of how the site **may** be structured. There are still some flaws and parts that need much more development. If you have any suggestions, questions, or criticisms, please email me.

## Purpose:
From what I understand, this site should be an introduction to concepts not covered in Saddleback's current computer science curriculum, along with an expansion upon topics that are. Along with this, I believe that the site could serve as a good **homepage** for the computer science club/cohort for advertisement, records, and general introduction to the club.

## Sections:
Here is an incomplete list of sections I think could be covered under this site. For any sections where I have written examples, I will provide links to the respective writeups (exemplary, not finalized).
- Comp Sci Club info
  - Club Meeting Notes (if they prove useful) 
    - [10/13/23](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/meetings/10.13.23)
    - [10/27/23](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/meetings/10.27.23)
- Explanations for algorithmic, data science, and math problems
  - [Non Repeating Number Problem](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/coding-problems/non-repeating) created by comp sci club
  - [Numbers Up to N Problems](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/coding-problems/nums-up-to-n) also created by comp sci club
- Pages may be able to serve as a guide to create comp sci workshops for the club

## Philosophies, Collaboration, et al.:
One of my goals is to make a cohesive, organized site that has good documentation, permitting anyone to contribute if they have some specialized knowledge to add and a little bit of time.
- Will create a specification guide and style guide for collaboration between contributors on the site
- Using GitHub and Git for collaboration; this should provide a good learning experience for everyone involved.  

## Concrete Ideas:
- Sections on specific programming languages and development workflows, with in-depth tutorials on all sub-concepts
  - Python: develop pages using club resources, integrating this with algorithmic and data structure problems
  - Git and GitHub: Extremely important and widely used in modern industry, this will be one of the first sets of articles I write
  - Algorithmic and Mathematical concepts used: Sub-articles will be used to explain the concepts behind specific algorithms in a more abstract mathematical way.
