To whom it may concern, everything following is my own ideas of how the site **may** be structured. There are still some flaws, and parts which need much more development. If you have any suggestions, questions, critisisms, or comments please email me.

## Purpose:
From what I understand, this site should be an introduction to concepts not covered in Saddleback's current commputer science cirriculum, along with expansion upon topics that are. Along with this, it seems like the site could serve as a good **homepage** for the computer science club/cohort for advertisement, records, and general introduction to the club.

## Sections:
Here is an incomplete list of sections I think could be covered under this site. Any sections where I have written examples for I will provided links to my writeups for.
- Comp Sci Club info
  - Club Meeting Notes (if they prove useful) 
    - [10/13/23](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/meetings/10.13.23)
    - [10/27/23](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/meetings/10.27.23)
- Explanations to algorithmic, data science, and math problems
  - [Non Repeating Number Problem](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/coding-problems/non-repeating) created by comp sci club
  - [Numbers Up to N Problems](https://matt-reese12.github.io/cs-club/coding-problems/nums-up-to-n) also created by comp sci club
- Pages may be able to serve as a guide to create comp sci workshop for the club and/or in other places

## Philosophies, Collaboration, et al.:
One of my goals is to make a cohesive, organized site that has good documentation allowing anyone to contribute if they have some specialized knowledge to add.
- Will create a specification guided and style-guide for collaboration between contributers on the site
- Using github and git for colloboration; this should provide a good learning experience for everyone involved.  

## Concrete Ideas:
- Sections on specific programming langauges, development workflows, with in-depth tutorial on all sub-concepts
  - Python: develop pages using club resources, integrating this with algorithmic and data structure problems
  - Git and Github: Extremely important and widely used in modern industry, this will be one of the first set of articles I write
  - Algorithmic and Mathmatical concepts used: Subarticles used to explain the concepts behind certain algorithms in a more abstract mathematical way.
